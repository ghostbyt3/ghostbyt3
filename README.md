## Hi there 👋

I'm a security researcher focused on red teaming and web application security, with a strong interest in reverse engineering, exploit development, and low-level Windows internals.

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

- **[WinDriver‑EXP](https://github.com/ghostbyt3/WinDriver-EXP)**  
     A repository of Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) for vulnerable Windows drivers, written by me.

- **[BYOVDFinder](https://github.com/ghostbyt3/BYOVDFinder)**  
    Identifies LOLDrivers that are not blocked by the active HVCI policy — ideal for BYOVD scenarios.

- **[Patch‑Tuesday](https://github.com/ghostbyt3/patch-tuesday)**  
    A site that efficiently tracks Microsoft Patch Tuesday updates for vulnerability analysis and patch diffing. The full website is published at [patch-tuesday.pwnfuzz.com](https://patch-tuesday.pwnfuzz.com).

## 💡 Blog & Research

- I publish my own technical research and learning notes on [ghostbyt3.github.io](https://ghostbyt3.github.io/). The content ranges from Windows kernel internals and exploit techniques to deep dives on specific CVEs and personal notes on topics I’m currently exploring.

- In parallel, I co-manage [labs.pwnfuzz.com](https://labs.pwnfuzz.com), which serves as a platform for vulnerability research under the PwnFuzz organization. There, we publish Patch Tuesday breakdowns, vulnerability write-ups, and n-day exploit analyses.

Thanks for stopping by! I’m always up for discussing kernel internals, reverse-engineering, and offensive tooling. 🚀
